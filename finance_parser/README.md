# Finance Transaction Parser

A simple Python script to read bank-specific transaction CSVs and parse them into categories.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- tkinter (`brew install python-tk` on macOS)

## Usage

- Set up a categories JSON file (modify the path as needed) like the example below:
```
{
    "categories": {
        "Groceries": [
            "groceries",
            "trader joe",
            "mochi",
            "onion",
            "grapes",
            "cookies",
            "milk",
            "paper towels",
            "apples",
            "factor",
            "frozen meal"
        ],
        "Restaurants": [
            "dinner",
            "restaurant",
            "pho",
            "korean",
            "meal"
        ]
    }
}
```
- `python3 venmo_parser.py` to run the script.
- Select the CSV file to parse. I recommend your monthly Venmo transaction statement.

Any transaction containing any of the keywords (wildcard) in the categories will be assigned to that category.

Category Totals:

  Groceries          -102.20   True
      Other          -973.40   True
Restaurants           -53.15   True
```

If the transaction is a 'charge', it is counted as a positive amount. If it is a 'payment', it is counted as a negative amount.
